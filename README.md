# Computer-Organization-Cs224

Computer Organization 
This includes 7 lab codes in MIPS Assembly, Verilog, low-level C environment. 

lab1;
By MIPS Assembly, implementing non-branching non-jumping program with I/O,
math calculation in a loop, sorting and searching. 

lab2;
By MIPS Assembly, matrix operations, floating point instructions and routines.

lab3;
By Verilog, implementing mips module and datapath module.

lab4;
By Verilog and BASYS2 board, converting single-cycle MIPS processor into pipelined processor. 
Pipelined registers, MUXes, hazard unit etc in datapath are used. 

lab5;
By MIPS Assembly, implementing mips program on matrices to see effects of cache design parameters,
loops and hit rate for specific program. 

lab6;
By mikroC IDE and Beti PIC32 Card, implementing push-button program.

lab7;
By mikroC IDE and Beti PIC32 Card and BASYS2 board, implementing programs for example;
push buttons, LEDs, 7 segment displays, slide switches, LCD display and playing song etc.
